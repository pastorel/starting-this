how to figure out how to use github

I feel pushed to do this, so here I am.

Apart that I have no idea what is this all about, I really do hope that everything comes to place and with or without real understanding, things will get to work


Yeah, this dude seems to have the right knowledge, I totally can see it on his face, maybe it's the right time to listen to someone 

(Yes! Am I nailing it or what? I am conding already, I feel worthy!!! Title on my desk: full stack markdown programmer)

Here is the dude saying all this:

He claims to rank 15th around here, right after someone named Linus, which is 1st, but maybe is me, total noob, not hearing right Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ ?

I've seen images introduced here, I do not now how to do this on my own, I guess I really need help.
Looks like this a PC feature only, as I don't have drag and drop on mobile, and uploading file just inserts a long text link and no thumbnail or embedded media...
Like in ðŸ†˜ ?
Not like in V-sauce, but there

Why is there a "Blame" button already on top of my readme? Is this how bullying works here?!?

Not really sure if this is what I wanted.
Going back to github lessons - too many unclear issues for me here

Why is it a readme.md? Is this a TLD? Can I pick another one?

Dude, am I commiting here or what... and I didn't even start any project yet!
Keep forgetting to hit Previews changes and only then commit
