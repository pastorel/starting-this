how to figure out how to use github

I feel pushed to do this, so here I am.

Apart that I have no idea what is this all about, I really do hope that everything comes to place and with or without real understanding, things will get to work


Yeah, this dude seems to have the right knowledge, I totally can see it on his face, maybe it's the right time to listen to someone 

I've seen images introduced here, I do not now how to do this on my own, I guess I really need help.

Like in ðŸ†˜ ?

Not like in sauce, but close

Why is there a "Blame" button already on top of my readme? Is this how bullying works here?!?

Not really sure if this is what I wanted.
Going back to github lessons - too many unclear issues for me here

Why is it a readme.md? Is this a TLD? Can I pick another one?
